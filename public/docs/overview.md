# Wiki - Organize and Share Your Knowledge

**Build your personal knowledge base and share pages with your community.**

## What it does

The Wiki plugin lets you create, organize, and browse markdown pages in a tree structure. Write private notes for yourself, then publish pages to make them available to everyone. Other users can comment and react to published pages.

## Key Features

- **Tree-structured pages** - Organize content hierarchically with parent/child pages
- **Rich markdown editor** - Write with bold, italic, headings, lists, code blocks, and more
- **Private and public** - Pages start private; publish them when ready to share
- **Comments and reactions** - Discuss published pages with emoji reactions
- **Page icons** - Assign ASCII/emoji icons to pages for quick visual identification
- **Subpage listings** - Optionally show child pages as a navigable list below content
- **Sidebar browsing** - Quick access to your private and public pages from the sidebar
- **Study plan integration** - Tag pages with action labels to make them triggerable exercises
